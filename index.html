      I was born in south of Poland. In 2009 I've come to Netherlands.
      Since then, while living in Utrecht, I was working for few logistics companies. 
      During that time, I've learned a lot about efficient warehousing, planing within time restrains and "on the spot" problem solving.
      Meanwhile, I've spent my free time on DIY's (metal and wood working, electronics), computers (gaming, overclocking and small repairs),
      music (poorly playing on bass and acoustic guitar) and few other little things. Recently I've decided, that it is time to leave warehouses behind
      and try something more challenging. That's how I've found Codaisseur. I hope that this course will help me start my journey in to the world of 
      Web Development.
