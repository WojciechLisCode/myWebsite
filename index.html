      I was born in the south of Poland. In 2009 I've come to the Netherlands. 
      Since then, while living in Utrecht, I was working for few logistics companies. 
      During that time, I've learned a lot about efficient warehousing, planning within time restraints, and "on the spot" problem-solving. 
      Meanwhile, I've spent my free time on DIY's (metal and woodworking, electronics), computers (gaming, overclocking, and small repairs), 
      music (poorly playing on bass and acoustic guitar), and few other little things. 
      Recently I've decided, that it is time to leave warehouses behind and try something more challenging. 
      That's how I've found Codaisseur. I hope that this course will help me start my journey into the world of Web Development.
